# prisma overview

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit and next-generation Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for Node.js and TypeScript. It simplifies database access and management in modern applications by providing:

1. **Prisma Client**: An auto-generated and type-safe query builder that simplifies database queries.
2. **Prisma Migrate**: A migration system for evolving your database schema in a safe and declarative manner.
3. **Prisma Studio**: A graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing and editing data in your database.

Prisma enhances developer productivity by automating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, increasing type safety, and making database access more intuitive. It supports various databases and is ideal for building production-grade, robust, and scalable web applications.
