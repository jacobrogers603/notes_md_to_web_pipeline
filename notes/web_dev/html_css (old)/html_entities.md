# HTML Entities
This allows for special characters to be typed into httml.
**Although you can paste it into VSC, some browsers may not support it, thus why HTML entities are required.**

Using > or < its best to use an html entity as well to not confuse w/ html code.

*For example:*
| result | entity |
| ------ | ------ |
|   &    | &amp   |
|   ™    | &trade |
|   €    | &euro  |
