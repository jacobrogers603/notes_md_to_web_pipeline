# Definition

A framework is a **collection of tools, libraries, and best practices** that provide a structured foundation for developing web applications.
A standard way to build and deploy applications. 


They consist of:

- pre-written code
- architecture and design patterns
- libraries and components


# Framework vs library
**Framework**: A framework provides a complete solution for developing applications. It typically dictates the application structure and provides a wide range of functionalities, covering things like routing, state management, and database interactions. Frameworks are more opinionated and often follow a specific design pattern like MVC (Model-View-Controller).

**Library**: A library, on the other hand, offers specific functionality and is generally focused on a particular aspect of the application, like React does with UIs. It leaves more decisions and application design in the hands of the developer.
