        A positioned element is an element whose computed position value is
        either relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky. (In other words, it’s
        anything except static.)
      </li>
      <li>
        A relatively positioned element is an element whose computed position
        value is relative. The top and bottom properties specify the vertical
        offset from its normal position; the left and right properties specify
        the horizontal offset.
      </li>
      <li>
        An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position
        value is absolute or fixed. The top, right, bottom, and left properties
        specify offsets from the edges of the element’s containing block. (The
        containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is
        positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset.
        The element establishes a new block formatting context (BFC) for its
        contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed position
        value is sticky. It’s treated as relatively positioned until its
        containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting top to
        value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it scrolls
        within), at which point it is treated as “stuck” until meeting the
        opposite edge of its containing block.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="position-is-a-css-property-that-can-have-the-values-of">
      position is a css property that can have the values of:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          static: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the
          document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have
          <strong>no effect</strong>. This is the default value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          fixed: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no
          space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is
          positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the
          viewport in the case of visual media. Its final position is determined
          by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
          <em
            >It will scroll with the page and always stay in the browser window!
            ALSO: To make the elements below the nav bar, that would be using
            the fixed property, add <strong>padding</strong> to the top of the
            body so that they aren’t under the nav bar when the user is scrolled
            all the way up.</em
          >
          This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed
          documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          absolute: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no
          space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is
          positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to
          the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the
          values of top, right, bottom, and left.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          relative: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of
          the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values
          of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the
          position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element
          in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          sticky: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the
          document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor
          and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including
          table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and
          left. The offset does not affect the position of any other
          elements.This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a
          sticky element “sticks” to its nearest ancestor that has a “scrolling
          mechanism” (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or
          overlay), even if that ancestor isn’t the nearest actually scrolling
          ancestor.

    <p>
      CSS elements that are below, in the CSS file, another element, will
      generally appear above that element on the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>z-index</strong> will override the default layering property and
      force them to a specific layer.

    <h2 id="identifying-the-containing-block">
      Identifying the containing block
    </h2>
    <p>
      The process for identifying the containing block depends entirely on the
      value of the element’s position property:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        If the position property is static, relative, or sticky, the containing
        block is formed by the edge of the content box of the nearest ancestor
        element that is either a block container (such as an inline-block,
        block, or list-item element) or establishes a formatting context (such
        as a table container, flex container, grid container, or the block
        container itself).
      </li>
      <li>
        If the position property is absolute, the containing block is formed by
        the edge of the padding box of the nearest ancestor element that has a
        position value other than static (fixed, absolute, relative, or sticky).
      </li>
      <li>
        If the position property is fixed, the containing block is established
        by the viewport (in the case of continuous media) or the page area (in
        the case of paged media).
      </li>
      <li>
        If the position property is absolute or fixed, the containing block may
        also be formed by the edge of the padding box of the nearest ancestor
        element that has the following:
        <ul>
          <li>A transform or perspective value other than none</li>
          <li>A will-change value of transform or perspective</li>
          <li>
            A filter value other than none or a will-change value of filter
            (only works on Firefox)
          </li>
          <li>
            A contain value of layout, paint, strict or content (e.g. contain:
            paint;)
          </li>
          <li>A container-type value other than normal</li>
          <li>
            A backdrop-filter other than none (e.g. backdrop-filter:
            blur(10px);)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </body>
