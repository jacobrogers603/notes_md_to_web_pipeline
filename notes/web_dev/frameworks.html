      A framework is a
      <strong>collection of tools, libraries, and best practices</strong> that
      provide a structured foundation for developing web applications. A
      standard way to build and deploy applications.
    </p>
    <p>They consist of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pre-written code</li>
      <li>architecture and design patterns</li>
      <li>libraries and components</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Framework</strong>: A framework provides a complete solution for
      developing applications. It typically dictates the application structure
      and provides a wide range of functionalities, covering things like
      routing, state management, and database interactions. Frameworks are more
      opinionated and often follow a specific design pattern like MVC
      (Model-View-Controller).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Library</strong>: A library, on the other hand, offers specific
      functionality and is generally focused on a particular aspect of the
      application, like React does with UIs. It leaves more decisions and
      application design in the hands of the developer.
