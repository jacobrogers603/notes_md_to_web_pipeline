    <p>We need to choose a tech stack.</p>
    <p>
      There are considerations to take into account such as hirability and
      scalability. We want to make our own businesses, but also need to land a
      remote job in the short term to gain the time freedom.

      static site = same content, always same dynamic site = will populate parts
      of the site differently for different users (ie youtube)
    </p>
    <p>
      the user types in the URL, looks up domain name, finds IP address, routes
      to that IP address w/ routing process, sends HTTP request from client,
      reaches server, the server analyzes it and preforms needed server side
      logic for specific user (if dynamic), will sends info back to client,
      displays.
    </p>
    <p>
      for static site, the server sends back html, css, and js to the client,
      the clientâ€™s browser will parse all that and render the web page to the
      user. This is sent to the client zipped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      html is a tree, css is layering ontop of the html tree, will style nodes
      of that tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a dynamic site there are components that have fields that get filled
      in based on the user. For youtube, some backend lang will determine which
      things to fill in the fields with. An HTML template is filled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      there are different templating languages, an entire template for the web
      page and the template is made and all sent together
    </p>
    <p>
      react creates a virtual dom in memory, will update the actual dom to
      reflect the virtual dom. The entire dom gets rerendered any time there is
      a change in the virtual dom, the whole dom gets reloaded. With vue only
      that specific component gets re rendered. Svelte does it down to the level
      of elements.
