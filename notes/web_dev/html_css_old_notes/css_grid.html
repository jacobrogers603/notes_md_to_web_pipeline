    <h1 id="css-grid">CSS Grid</h1>
    <p>use by:</p>
    <pre><code>display: grid;
grid-template-column: 100px 100px; (means a grid with two columns each w/ a width of 100 px)</code></pre>
    <p>
      grids will maintain alignment much better than using an in-line block.
    </p>
    <p>for example:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="resources/gridAlignment.png" alt="grid" />
      <figcaption>grid</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <em
        >Here the second column of the grid has a second p element added to it
        and it buts it below the first text presrving the width of the column
        and growing its height.</em
      >
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="resources/moreColumnsMakesRowsGrids.png" alt="gridRows" />
      <figcaption>gridRows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <em
        >Here there were only 3 column sizes specified but 4 divs in the div
        that was given the grid display property. Thus a second row was created
        and the 4th div was wrapped around and put in the 1st column, 2nd
        row.</em
      >
    </p>
    <pre><code>grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr; (1fr means will take up the remaining space on the line).</code></pre>
    <p>
      the coefficient in front of the fr means how much of that space the fr
      will get. For ex: if you have grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; both columns
      will take up the same amount of space and both of them together will take
      up all the space. 2fr 1fr means the 1st column will be twice as wide as
      the first.
    </p>
    <pre><code>column-gap: 20px;
row-gap: 20px;</code></pre>
    <p>This will add gaps between the rows and columns.</p>

      Making grid adjust number of columns due to screen size
    </h2>
    <pre><code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));</code></pre>
    <p>
      <em
        >This sets up a basic grid where each item takes up at least 200px if
        thereâ€™s space. The grid will try to fit as many columns as it can,
        depending on the viewport width.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The grid-template-columns property of CSS Grid, combined with the repeat()
      function and auto-fill or auto-fit keywords, allows the grid to adapt to
      different container widths.
