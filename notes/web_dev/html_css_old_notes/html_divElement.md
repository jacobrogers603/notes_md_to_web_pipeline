# html DIV element
div is a box, container.

It is a block element by default. Keep it as such to make a vertical layout.

Make the div a display: inline-block to make it a horizontal layout.
*A div by default has a width of 100% even if it is a inline-block, so to make a horizontal layout you need to make them smaller than the container that they reside in to fit multiple items on one line.
