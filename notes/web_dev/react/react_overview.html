        <strong>A JS library for building UIs.</strong> It is NOT a

      <li>
        React is specifically focused on the view layer of web applications
        (i.e., what the user sees and interacts with in the browser). It allows
        developers to create reusable UI components.
      </li>
      <li>It is best at single-page-applications.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Component-based</strong>: Uses reusable components that are
        self-contained blocks of code that manage their own state and combine to
        form full UIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Declarative</strong>: you define how you want your UI to look at
        each state of your app and it automatically updates and renders the
        right components when your data changes.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        <strong>virtual DOM</strong>: is used by react which is a lightweight
        copy of the actual <a href="../DOM_overview.md">DOM</a>. This makes
        updating the DOM faster.
      </li>
      <li><strong>reusable comps</strong>: Fixes problems of redundancy.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>state management</strong>: keeps ui in sync with everything
