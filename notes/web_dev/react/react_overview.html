    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A JS library for building UIs.</strong> It is NOT a
        <a href="../frameworks.md">framework</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        React is specifically focused on the view layer of web applications
        (i.e., what the user sees and interacts with in the browser). It allows
        developers to create reusable UI components.
      </li>
      <li>It is best at single-page-applications.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Component-based</strong>: Uses reusable components that are
        self-contained blocks of code that manage their own state and combine to
        form full UIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Declarative</strong>: you define how you want your UI to look at
        each state of your app and it automatically updates and renders the
        right components when your data changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        A JS bundle must be loaded by the client’s browser for react pages to
        work.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="problems-that-react-solves">Problems that React solves</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>virtual DOM</strong>: is used by react which is a lightweight
        copy of the actual <a href="../DOM_overview.md">DOM</a>. This makes
        updating the DOM faster. Allows you to update parts of the page without
        reloading the page.
      </li>
      <li><strong>reusable comps</strong>: Fixes problems of redundancy.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>state management</strong>: keeps ui in sync with everything
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JSX</strong>: allows you to write code that is formatted like
        html but is actually js
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="components">Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be created with either classes or functions.</li>
      <li>
        They can have <strong>states</strong> which is an object that determines
        how a component renders and behaves.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="file-structure-explanation">File structure explanation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>package.json</strong>: shows your dependencies and scripts (you
        can define commands here too).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>public</strong>: – <strong>index.html</strong>: The single page
        of the single-page-all that is being loaded. Note how there is a div
        with id root.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>src</strong>: where we put components and states –
        <strong>index.js</strong>: we are grabbing the div id=“root” from the
        index.html and we are inserting out app into that div (App.js) –
        <strong>App.js</strong>: Where we do most of the editing. contains the
        ROOT APP COMPONENT. All components that we end up creating will be in
        the main root app component. This file contains a function where it
        looks like there is HTML written; it is actually JSX. All code must be
        contained within the app div (or empty angle-brackets) because JSX
        expressions must have only one parent element.
      </li>
    </ul>
