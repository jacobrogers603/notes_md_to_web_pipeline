      building for production in react

    <p>
      When we are ready to build the page for production run the following
      command. This will make a build directory in your project which is
      everything you would be hosting. The rest of the stuff in your project is
      only for development.
    </p>
    <pre><code>npm run build</code></pre>
    <p>To test it on your local machine, run serve, first install that.</p>
    <pre><code>npm install serve
serve -s build -p 8000 // or some port number, build is build directory.</code></pre>
