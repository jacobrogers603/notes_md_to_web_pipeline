JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JS commonly used with React.
It allows you to write HTML-like code directly in your JS files.

# Basics

1. HTML in JS: JSX allows you to write HTML structures in the same file as your JS code.
2. JS expressions: You can embed JS expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly-braces. Thus you can use JS variables, functions, etc in JSX.
3. component structure: In react, JSX is used to describe structure of the component's view. Each React component can return JSX in its render method, defining what should be rendered on screen.

# examples

    const elem = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

# TS

you can use typescript with react instead, thus tsx not jsx.
