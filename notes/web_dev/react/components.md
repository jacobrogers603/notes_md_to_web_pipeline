title: "react components"

*recommended to have ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippers extension in vsc*

start by making a components dir in src dir.

# example (function based component)

In a file called `Header.jsx (or.tsx)` type `rafce` (with the ES7 extension) to create the boilerplate of an arrow function component. Here create the component you want using jsx. *Note: you can delete the line `import React from 'react'` line as this is no longer needed.* 

Then back in `App.js`, you can `import Header from './components/Header`. You can put it in your main div as follows: `<Header />`, and it will appear in the app.
