A div container can have a display property of flex.

The now, flex container, has control over how its immediate children are laid out

**By default the flex-direction is row**

- When the flex-direction is row the cross axis runs veritcally and the main axis runs horizontally
- When the flex-direction is column the cross axis runs horizontally and the main axis runs vetically
- Justify-content is for the main axis
- Align-items is for the cross axis

- changing item-width will change how much space the items take up
