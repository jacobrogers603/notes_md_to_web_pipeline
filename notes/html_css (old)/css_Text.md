# Text: Changing text properties in css

## Font
- Font can be changed with **font-family**
- Font size can be changed with **font-size**
- To set how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed use **font-weight** ie making something bold.
- Font can be made italic with **font-style** or: oblique, normal (default), initial (browser default), inherit (inherit its value from its parent element).
- **text-decoration** can make text underline, line-through, overline, etc
- fonts are usally assigned numbers for their weights that correspond with regular, medium, and bold. For example Roboto has 400, 500, & 700 for regular, medium, and bold respectively

## Text alignment
**text-align** will set text either left, right, center, justified...
**width** can force the max length of a line of text and make it wrap around to a new line.
**line-height** will set the space between each line of text.
