    <p>
      There are many things one could do in their life to make it worth while.
      But before we get ahead of ourselves, remember that there are things that
      all men share in common with wanting.. the Maslow’s pyramid of needs.

    <h3 id="physiological-basic-need">1. physiological (basic need)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>air ✅</li>
      <li>water 〰️</li>
      <li>food 〰️</li>
      <li>heat ✅</li>
      <li>clothes 〰️</li>
      <li>urination / excretion ✅</li>
      <li>shelter ✅</li>
      <li>sleep 〰️</li>
      <li>cleanliness / grooming 〰️</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These come before everything else. If you don’t have these basic
      <em>physiological</em> needs met, your life will not be optimal and
      anything you are trying to on a level above this one will be done poorly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get this under control, we need to
      <strong>plan out the day</strong> with a calendar. Groom in the morning,
      get sleep such that you wake up naturally and get up as soon as that
      happens. This probably means that you have to budget 9.5hrs of sleep and
      maybe you’ll wake up earlier than you expected. Water we should track on
      my fitness pal app, along with food. Food is tough on here, but for now
      you can have Lauren do it when she comes and otherwise just buy healthy.
      When Lauren is here a routine can be formed that is followed weekly or
      semi-weekly to maintain a healthy and full diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothes, we need to sort through what we have, throw away things that
      don’t make us feel confident / look good, buy new outfits, plan outfits
      with consciousness that follow rules of dressing like layers, colors, high
      quality, etc. Because if you dress like shit, you can’t operate at a full
      mode of confidence. But if you love what you are wearing, you’ll operate
      better than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notice, we are failing already on these areas, and at the very minium,
      we need to get the day planned with a calendar, sleep enough, track our
      water, and try to eat healthy. That will improve a lot for you very
      quickly in terms of being able to do things higher up in the pyramid.

    <h3 id="safety-and-security-basic-need">
      2. Safety and Security (basic need)
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Health ✅</li>
      <li>Personal Security ✅</li>
      <li>Emotional Security 〰️</li>
      <li>Financial Security ❌</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are your other basic needs that cannot be taken care of until after
      the first category of basic needs is sufficiently met. Note how we are
      mainly focusing on financial security and we have gotten much better in
      emotional security than we were in the past but maybe some small problems
      remain when talking to girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we are putting most of our focus on the financial security aspect,
      which is great, because it is the first ❌ we see, where the need is
      essentially mostly not met at all, where all other deficiencies are of the
      〰️ category where they are met to a good enough degree to move past them,
      but they are still dragging us down by not being fully complete. There are
      easy targets in the first category of basic needs that we should focus on
      getting to the ✅ category fully such that we can attack the financial
      security category with much more efficiency and vigor.

      <li>Intimacy 〰️</li>

      <li>Receiving and giving love and affection 〰️</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Need to work on getting into more groups. Maybe join a tennis group, get a
      bigger group of friends, etc. More intimacy is needed as well, keep trying
      at that as best you can, use the apps, try to talk to people in public,
      you can do it! Work on the trust issue with Bogdan maybe. Take notes in
      accordance with the robert greene book on seduction concerning your sexual
      escapades.

      Most of this will be met when we have a strong tier three done with great
