# What do you want in life?

There are many things one could do in their life to make it worth while. But before we get ahead of ourselves, remember that there are things that all men share in common with wanting.. the Maslow's pyramid of needs. 

## My Maslow's Pyramid Wants

### 1. physiological (basic need)

- air ✅
- water 〰️
- food 〰️
- heat ✅
- clothes 〰️
- urination / excretion ✅
- shelter ✅
- sleep 〰️
- cleanliness / grooming 〰️

These come before everything else. If you don't have these basic *physiological* needs met, your life will not be optimal and anything you are trying to on a level above this one will be done poorly.

To get this under control, we need to **plan out the day** with a calendar. Groom in the morning, get sleep such that you wake up naturally and get up as soon as that happens. This probably means that you have to budget 9.5hrs of sleep and maybe you'll wake up earlier than you expected. Water we should track on my fitness pal app, along with food. Food is tough on here, but for now you can have Lauren do it when she comes and otherwise just buy healthy. When Lauren is here a routine can be formed that is followed weekly or semi-weekly to maintain a healthy and full diet.

Clothes, we need to sort through what we have, throw away things that don't make us feel confident / look good, buy new outfits, plan outfits with consciousness that follow rules of dressing like layers, colors, high quality, etc. Because if you dress like shit, you can't operate at a full mode of confidence. But if you love what you are wearing, you'll operate better than usual.

But notice, we are failing already on these areas, and at the very minium, we need to get the day planned with a calendar, sleep enough, track our water, and try to eat healthy. That will improve a lot for you very quickly in terms of being able to do things higher up in the pyramid.

### 2. Safety and Security (basic need)

- Health ✅
- Personal Security ✅
- Emotional Security 〰️
- Financial Security ❌

These are your other basic needs that cannot be taken care of until after the first category of basic needs is sufficiently met. Note how we are mainly focusing on financial security and we have gotten much better in emotional security than we were in the past but maybe some small problems remain when talking to girls. 

While we are putting most of our focus on the financial security aspect, which is great, because it is the first ❌ we see, where the need is essentially mostly not met at all, where all other deficiencies are of the 〰️ category where they are met to a good enough degree to move past them, but they are still dragging us down by not being fully complete. There are easy targets in the first category of basic needs that we should focus on getting to the ✅ category fully such that we can attack the financial security category with much more efficiency and vigor.

My plan for financial security is known [web dev](2_webDevPlans.html).

### 3. Belongingness and Love (psychological need)    

- Family ✅
- Friendship ✅
- Intimacy 〰️
- Trust in those in your relationships 〰️ 
- Acceptance by and membership in group(s) 〰️ 
- Receiving and giving love and affection 〰️ 

Need to work on getting into more groups. Maybe join a tennis group, get a bigger group of friends, etc. More intimacy is needed as well, keep trying at that as best you can, use the apps, try to talk to people in public, you can do it! Work on the trust issue with Bogdan maybe. Take notes in accordance with the robert greene book on seduction concerning your sexual escapades.

### 4. Esteem Needs (psychological need)

- prestige ❌
- feeling of accomplishment 〰️
- confidence 〰️
- respect of others ✅
- being a unique individual 〰️

Most of this will be met when we have a strong tier three done with great income and having had developed many skills and wisdom in that journey.

### 5. self actualization (self-fulfillment needs)

- cognitive needs
    - creativity 〰️
    - foresight 〰️
    - curiosity ✅
    - meaning 〰️
- aesthetic needs
    - appreciation of beauty in the world 〰️
    - being around beauty daily ❌
    - visual beauty 〰️
    -  existential beauty 〰️
    - beautiful appearance of one's body and look ❌
- self-actualization
    - quality wife acquisition ❌
    - good parenting ❌
    - utilizing and developing talents and skills 〰️
    - pursing and accomplishing goals 〰️
