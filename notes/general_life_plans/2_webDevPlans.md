# Intro
Be a front end remote dev (maybe multiple jobs) to earn money remotely for now

Also work on building up a software (probably SAAS) business in the background

# Timeline

1. Learn React and make an app in it to put on your portfolio. This should be your notes app. I want
login, hosting on linode, secure keeping of my notes, ability for someone else to make an account so they
can see that it works. Online editing, in md, for phone and desktop sizes.Use tailwind, TS, and React, and SQL.

2. More FEM challenges...

3. Apply for many react remote jobs. Get at least 2 at once.

4. Learn svelteKit in the meantime, also put that on your cv and make a project using it.

5. While working jobs, build up a business and product.
