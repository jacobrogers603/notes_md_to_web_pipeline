# Women are not rational actors

Women should not be treated as rational actors, they do not think as men do, remember this, they are to be treated as children! They need to be told what to do, how to do things, where to go, EXACTLY! So decisions should be levied on them.

## Decisions need to be made for them

You need to be telling them what to do, always. For example: when the girl asked me in Pensacola "oooo what does that mean" respond "that means I'm coming to pick you up tonight." 

Women never wanna make decisions. Including on dating apps or in a bar, on what man to choose, so they probably won't. 

Think of how you treat Lauren. You tell her how to lead her life, she'll be happy.

# Protectors

Men should be protectors. These things include not just physical protection, but things like guidance as well; like how a parent would 

## Respect

Women will not give respect if you ask, only if you are worthy. Pass shit tests with maintaining frame, not becoming insecure, staying on your path despite her test. Women need to make sure that the man who is guiding them is competent. Respect is earned via these **stress tests**. DO NOT BEND (think how Bogdan treats Dasha).

# Cold approach tactic

First see if she likes you back: make eye contact, give smile, something, see reaction... if she doesn't reply in the NEGATIVE, this is a green light to go. Women do want to be approached by guys, that they choose. If you go to girls who don't want you to approach them, don't, you will fail. 

# Need to turn the tables

You need to be the one that she is supplicating to. 

## Patience

Better to have girls be warmed up to you "naturally" than otherwise. IE going to class with Amy... Put yourself in places where there is a lot of women with almost no competition. Better to be found in a socially acceptable way. Think, Robert Greene, approach indirectly. A girl will not want to make a decision every, so why would she wanna make a decision on a dating app or in a bar?? 

Appear in a social setting regularly, this takes some time. Like Trent going to coffee shop each day.

### Sex Industry

If you are in the business of sex, you'll get it. IE photographer.

### Need to find areas to meet women "naturally"

Need to set life up such that you can "naturally" meet women.
