    <h1 id="women-are-not-rational-actors">Women are not rational actors</h1>
    <p>
      Women should not be treated as rational actors, they do not think as men
      do, remember this, they are to be treated as children! They need to be
      told what to do, how to do things, where to go, EXACTLY! So decisions
      should be levied on them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decisions-need-to-be-made-for-them">
      Decisions need to be made for them
    </h2>
    <p>
      You need to be telling them what to do, always. For example: when the girl
      asked me in Pensacola “oooo what does that mean” respond “that means I’m
      coming to pick you up tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Women never wanna make decisions. Including on dating apps or in a bar, on
      what man to choose, so they probably won’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of how you treat Lauren. You tell her how to lead her life, she’ll
      be happy.
    </p>
    <h1 id="protectors">Protectors</h1>
    <p>
      Men should be protectors. These things include not just physical
      protection, but things like guidance as well; like how a parent would
    </p>
    <h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>
    <p>
      Women will not give respect if you ask, only if you are worthy. Pass shit
      tests with maintaining frame, not becoming insecure, staying on your path
      despite her test. Women need to make sure that the man who is guiding them
      is competent. Respect is earned via these <strong>stress tests</strong>.
      DO NOT BEND (think how Bogdan treats Dasha).
    </p>
    <h1 id="cold-approach-tactic">Cold approach tactic</h1>
    <p>
      First see if she likes you back: make eye contact, give smile, something,
      see reaction… if she doesn’t reply in the NEGATIVE, this is a green light
      to go. Women do want to be approached by guys, that they choose. If you go
      to girls who don’t want you to approach them, don’t, you will fail.
    </p>
    <h1 id="need-to-turn-the-tables">Need to turn the tables</h1>
    <p>You need to be the one that she is supplicating to.</p>
    <h2 id="patience">Patience</h2>
    <p>
      Better to have girls be warmed up to you “naturally” than otherwise. IE
      going to class with Amy… Put yourself in places where there is a lot of
      women with almost no competition. Better to be found in a socially
      acceptable way. Think, Robert Greene, approach indirectly. A girl will not
      want to make a decision every, so why would she wanna make a decision on a
      dating app or in a bar??
    </p>
    <p>
      Appear in a social setting regularly, this takes some time. Like Trent
      going to coffee shop each day.

    <h3 id="sex-industry">Sex Industry</h3>
    <p>If you are in the business of sex, you’ll get it. IE photographer.</p>
    <h3 id="need-to-find-areas-to-meet-women-naturally">
      Need to find areas to meet women “naturally”
    </h3>
    <p>Need to set life up such that you can “naturally” meet women.</p>
