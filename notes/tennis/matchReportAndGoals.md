# Match report from 1/20/24 & future goals

## Match report - 5-7 / 1-3 (ended due to time)

I was up 5-2, then lost 5 games and had a very bad time. I was able to win one more game in the second set somehow.

I was focusing on having my legs spread apart by the length of a tennis racket w/ my knees always bent and preparing early (far earlier than the time the ball bounces). This is advice I got from patrick M, former coach of serena williams. It worked well but there are still some issues I need to work on in my game.

## Issues I need to iron out and make clean

### Ground stroke take backs

My ground stroke take backs are leaving my racket-face open and thus pushing many of my balls long. I need to understand proper take back technique. Watch some videos, hopefully get a coach when we have money. Also on the forehand my racket is not cocked back it is angled up (maybe) and towards the court, I think it should be angled up and back away from the court at a 45 degree angle.

### Footwork

I want cleaner, more efficient footwork. Watch Novak, he isn't moving super fast, but very cleanly and efficiently. 

## Overview 

Work on:
- racket take backs
- footwork efficiency
- watching the ball, you always forget.
