      I was up 5-2, then lost 5 games and had a very bad time. I was able to win
      one more game in the second set somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was focusing on having my legs spread apart by the length of a tennis
      racket w/ my knees always bent and preparing early (far earlier than the
      time the ball bounces). This is advice I got from patrick M, former coach
      of serena williams. It worked well but there are still some issues I need
      to work on in my game.

    <h3 id="ground-stroke-take-backs">Ground stroke take backs</h3>
    <p>
      My ground stroke take backs are leaving my racket-face open and thus
      pushing many of my balls long. I need to understand proper take back
      technique. Watch some videos, hopefully get a coach when we have money.
      Also on the forehand my racket is not cocked back it is angled up (maybe)
      and towards the court, I think it should be angled up and back away from
      the court at a 45 degree angle.
    </p>
    <h3 id="footwork">Footwork</h3>
    <p>
      I want cleaner, more efficient footwork. Watch Novak, he isnâ€™t moving
      super fast, but very cleanly and efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Work on: - racket take backs - footwork efficiency - watching the ball,
      you always forget.
